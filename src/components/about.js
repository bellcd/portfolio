      <p>I have a unique background (certainly unique for a web developer!). I bring that background along with all the hard and soft skills I’ve learned along the way to each and every new project I’m involved with.</p>
      <p>It’s better if the project makes a real, positive impact on someone's life. Even better if it’s a big impact. If you have a real, big, positive impact project on lots of people’s lives ... well, congratulations! You have a unicorn project, and I’d love to help.</p>
